        <Section title="The Turn Cycle">
            <p>This is a multiplayer turn-based game where an Admin processes turns for all players simultaneously. The workflow is now much simpler:</p>
             <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-4">
                <li><strong className="text-white">1. Planning Phase:</strong> This is where you play! Assign actions to your tribe using the Action Panel. When you're done, click "Finalize Actions". Your view will change to "Waiting for Admin".</li>
                <li><strong className="text-white">2. Admin Processing:</strong> Once all players have submitted their turns, the Admin will click "Process All Turns" in their Admin Panel. This runs all the game logic on the server.</li>
                <li><strong className="text-white">3. Automatic Update:</strong> The game will automatically refresh for all players. There is no need to manually download or sync any files.</li>
                <li><strong className="text-white">4. Results Phase:</strong> After the game refreshes, you will see the results of the previous turn. Review them, and then click "Start Planning Next Turn" to begin your next move!</li>
            </ul>
        </Section>
        <Section title="Diplomacy">
            <p>You can manage your relationships with other tribes via the new Diplomacy panel.</p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 pl-4">
                 <li><strong className="text-white">Propose Alliance:</strong> You can send an alliance proposal to a tribe you are Neutral with. They will have a few turns to accept or reject it.</li>
                 <li><strong className="text-blue-400">Alliances:</strong> Allies share vision, allowing you to see their territory and any enemies they spot. You can also move your forces into an ally's garrisoned hex without starting a fight.</li>
                 <li><strong className="text-red-400">Declare War:</strong> You can declare war on any tribe. This is a formal action that takes effect at the end of the turn, changing your status to 'War'.</li>
            </ul>
        </Section>
        <Section title="Journeys & Travel Time">
            <p>Actions involving travel use the <strong className="text-white">Journey</strong> system, which has two speeds:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 pl-4">
                <li><strong className="text-white">Fast-Track Travel:</strong> Very short, non-aggressive journeys (e.g., Move, Scavenge, Scout to a nearby hex) are now resolved <strong className="text-amber-400">instantly</strong> during turn processing. A quick scavenge run will see your troops return with loot, ready for your next turn, all in one go.</li>
                <li><strong className="text-white">Standard Journeys:</strong> Longer journeys and all <strong className="text-red-400">Attack</strong> actions will always take at least one turn. These are dispatched as traveling groups that you can see on the map and track in the "Active Journeys" panel. This preserves the strategic warning for attacks.</li>
                <li>When planning, the game will still show you an <strong className="text-white">Estimated Travel Time</strong>. If the action can be fast-tracked, it will resolve immediately.</li>
            </ul>
        </Section>
         <Section title="Trade">
            <p>Trading is handled through the journey system. It's a multi-turn process involving risk and player interaction.</p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 pl-4">
                <li><strong className="text-white">Dispatch:</strong> You send a `Trade` caravan. It will travel to the target, which may take several turns.</li>
                <li><strong className="text-white">Arrival & Decision:</strong> When your caravan arrives, it enters a "waiting" state. The receiving player will see your offer in their "Pending Trade Offers" panel and has two turns to respond.</li>
                <li><strong className="text-white">The Return Journey:</strong> Once a decision is made (or the offer expires), a return journey is automatically created. This also takes time.</li>
                <li><strong className="text-white">Arrival Home:</strong> When the caravan returns, the goods and surviving guards are added back to your tribe.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 pl-4">
                <li><strong className="text-white">Troops:</strong> Your population. Needed for all actions and for defense. Consume food each turn.</li>
                <li><strong className="text-white">Weapons:</strong> Boost your combat power in attacks and defense.</li>
                <li><strong className="text-white">Food:</strong> A global resource used to feed troops and recruit new ones. If you run out, troops will starve and morale will plummet.</li>
                <li><strong className="text-white">Scrap:</strong> A global resource used for building weapons, outposts, and researching technology.</li>
                <li><strong className="text-white">Morale:</strong> Your tribe's happiness. Low morale can lead to desertions. Affected by food rations and combat outcomes.</li>
                <li><strong className="text-white">Rations:</strong> Set the food consumption rate. Generous rations boost morale but use more food, while Hard rations save food at the cost of morale.</li>
            </ul>
        </Section>
         <Section title="Combat">
            <p>When an attacking journey arrives at a destination with an enemy, combat is resolved. Both sides' power is calculated based on several factors:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 pl-4">
                <li>Number of <strong className="text-white">Troops</strong>.</li>

                <li>Tribe and Chief <strong className="text-white">Strength</strong> stats.</li>
                <li>Completed <strong className="text-white">Technologies</strong>.</li>
                <li>For the defender: <strong className="text-white">Terrain</strong> bonuses, <strong className="text-white">Fortifications</strong> (Home Base or Outpost), and a <code className="bg-slate-900 p-1 rounded">Defend</code> action bonus.</li>
            </ul>
             <p className="mt-2">If you attack a hex an enemy is moving <strong className="text-white">from</strong> in the same turn, you will <strong className="text-white">intercept</strong> them. Intercepted forces do not get any terrain or fortification bonuses.</p>
        </Section>
        <Section title="Technology & Chiefs">
             <p><strong className="text-white">Technology:</strong> Unlocks permanent bonuses for your tribe. To research, you must assign troops from a garrison. Progress is made each turn. Some POIs (like Research Labs) can speed this up.</p>
             <p><strong className="text-white">Chiefs:</strong> Powerful unique units with their own stats. They add to your max action limit, participate in actions to provide bonuses, and are acquired by owning the corresponding NFT and submitting a request for admin approval.</p>
